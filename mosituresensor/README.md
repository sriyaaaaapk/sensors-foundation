# Moisture Sensor Project

📌 **Purpose:**  
Reads soil moisture using a resistive two-pointed probe and displays the value on Serial Monitor.

🔧 **Components:**
- Arduino UNO  
- Resistive moisture sensor (2-pointed probe)  
- Jumper wires  

⚙️ **Logic:**  
- Analog value from sensor is read via A0 pin  
- Higher value → lower moisture (drier soil)  
- Printed to Serial Monitor every second

# Servo Motor Project

📌 **Purpose:**  
Rotates a servo motor to 0°, 90°, and 180° positions in sequence.

🔧 **Components:**
- Arduino UNO  
- Servo motor
- Jumper wires  

⚙️ **Logic:**  
- Servo is connected to pin 9  
- Rotates to 0°, then 90°, then 180° with 1-second delay  
- Current angle is printed to Serial Monitor
